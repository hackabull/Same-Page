###_Team Hack-A-Bull: 4 folks learning to code from Durham, NC_

This app is aimed at blended families (two households, where the kids move back and forth between parents or guardians), but could probably be used by any group of people trying to buy groceries together, keep a calendar, and have a shared to do list. We've got 3 pages so far with dreams of more to follow: 

**1) Main Welcome Page**
sign-in page? separate out what kids have access to vs. what parents have access to
(if id #1,2 you have access to all/if id > 2 then no access to wallet)

**2) Calendar** what is happening when to sync up 2 families
tech to look into/possibly use: Google Calendar API

**3) What-To-Bring** a reminder list for each child as they leave the one house and head to the other house
tech to look into/possibly use: Cats/Burger hw

Future iterations of this app might include: 

**4) A Virtual Wallet** an ongoing record of who pays for what
tech to look into/possibly use: Sequelize

**5) Food list/Meal Planner/Grocery Planner**
Meal Planner that carries over to grocery planner
tech to look into/possibly use: Yummly API

**6) Child-Locator**
See where your children are at any time via their phones.
