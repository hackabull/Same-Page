###_Team Hack-A-Bull: Tim, Anthony, Emily, & Allison_

# Project Name: TBD
This app is aimed at blended families (2 households, where kids move back and forth between parents or guardians), but could probably be used by any group of people trying to buy groceries together, keep a calendar, and have a shared to do list. We're envisioning 5 pages: 

**1) Main Welcome Page**
sign-in page? separate out what kids have access to vs. what parents have access to
(if id #1,2 you have access to all/if id > 2 then no access to wallet)

**2) Calendar** what is happening when to sync up 2 families
tech to look into/possibly use: Google Calendar API

**3) What-To-Bring** a reminder list for each child as they leave the one house and head to the other house
tech to look into/possibly use: Cats/Burger hw

**4) Virtual wallet** an ongoing record of who pays for what
tech to look into/possibly use: Sequelize

**5) Food list/Meal Planner/Grocery Planner**
Meal Planner that carries over to grocery planner
tech to look into/possibly use: Yummly API

_goals for future (but not neccessarily taking on with this iteration of project):
money mover
child-locator_

# Responsibilities

**Emily** Front-End Lead (not that we don't all do front-end but we defer to her front-end wireframe and styling)

Materialize & Isotope

**Anthony** Back-End Lead (not that Emily doesn't do any back end stuff, she is touching the code for the back-end)

_Do what to bring first b/c we have the code for that already_

_Break own into MVP, minimum viable product & do that_
