# Same Page
https://samepageapp.herokuapp.com/

This app is aimed at blended families (two households, where the kids move back and forth between parents or guardians), but could probably be used by any group of people trying to track money, keep a calendar, and have a shared to do list. 

## To get started
To see the entire log-in process, register a user profile.
Or, log-in using: 
### email _hackabulldurham@gmail.com_ 
### password _samepage_

We've got 4 pages so far with dreams of more to follow: 

### Sign-In/Registration Page --> Dashboard
Register as either a parent/guardian and assign user IDs to additional parents/guardians and children. 

### Calendar
A shared calendar for all parties to keep track of who's going where and when.

### To-Bring
A reminder list of items to bring for each child as they leave the one house and head to the other house.

### Message Board
A central spot for reminders, updates, and communiation between the two households.

### Wallet
An ongoing record of who pays for what and how much one household may owe the other.

Future iterations of this app might include:

_**Application Widgets**_ Choose from a selection of additional features and personalize your dashboard.

_**Comprehensive User Profiles**_ When each adult user views their profile page, they see the other adults paired with their profile, along with children.

_**Social Media Photo Share**_ A spot for one household to drop pictures and memories from their adventures for the other household to download and/or use.

_**Gift Hub**_ Keep track of who is getting what for Christmas, birthdays, holidays or brainstorm gift ideas for the future. 

_**Child-Locator**_ See where your children are at any time via their phones.

_**Sophisticated Wallet**_ Secure money moving options to allow for the actual transfer of money instead of just keeping track of transactions.  Track expenses by household and have monthly comparison totals stored.
