_Team Hack-A-Bull: 4 folks learning to code in Durham, NC_

This app is aimed at blended families (two households, where the kids move back and forth between parents or guardians), but could probably be used by any group of people trying to buy groceries together, keep a calendar, and have a shared to do list. We've got 4 pages so far with dreams of more to follow: 

**Sign-In/Registration Page --> Dashboard**
Register as either a parent/guardian or child, if it's your first time to the site, then head on to the Dashboard.

**Calendar** 
A shared calendar for all parties to keep track of who's going where and when.

**To-Bring** 
A reminder list for each child as they leave the one house and head to the other house.

**Message Board**
A central spot for reminders, updates, and communiation between the two households.

**Wallet**
An ongoing record of who pays for what and how much one household may owe the other.

Future iterations of this app might include: 

**Child-Locator**
See where your children are at any time via their phones.

**Updated Wallet**
Sophisticated and secure money moving options to allow for the actual transfer of money instead of just keeping track of transactions.
